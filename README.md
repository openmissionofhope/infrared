# Infrared  
*A privacy-preserving system for detecting signs of life at scale.*

Infrared is a minimal-data framework designed to detect **population-level life signals** without tracking, identifying, or profiling any individual.  
Just as living creatures emit **infrared warmth** that reveals presence without revealing identity, Infrared measures **aggregate activity patterns**—not people.

Infrared ensures that **large-scale disappearance, collapse, or catastrophic harm** cannot occur silently, while keeping every person’s privacy, dignity, and legal protections intact.

## 🧭 Purpose

**Infrared exists to answer one question:**

> **Is life still present here?**

It monitors continuity of existence through *aggregate warmth signals*:

- overall activity levels  
- event density  
- communication volume  
- temporal presence patterns  
- system “pulses” and “heartbeats”  

By tracking only **signals of life**, not the identities generating them, Infrared can detect:

- sudden population drops  
- vanishing activity in a region or system  
- abnormal declines  
- catastrophic events  
- infrastructure failures  
- natural disasters  
- concentrated disappearance patterns  

All **without ever touching personal data**.

## 🛡️ Privacy and Legal Safety

Infrared is built to be inherently safe:

- **No identity tracking**  
- **No location tracking**  
- **No personal identifiers**  
- **No behavioral profiling**  
- **No cross-session linking**  
- **No user consent requirements**  
- **No GDPR/CCPA exposure**  
- **No surveillance value**  

Even if all Infrared data were leaked publicly, **no individual could be found, inferred, or reconstructed**.

Infrared observes only **population heat**, never individuals.

## 🌡️ How It Works

At its core, Infrared transforms raw activity into a **Warmth Index**.  
This index reflects the presence or absence of “life” in a system or community.

### Signals *can* include:
- message volume  
- general access patterns  
- anonymous heartbeat events  
- uptime or liveness metrics  
- non-identifying metadata  
- any signal that implies “something is alive here”  

### Signals *never* include:
- usernames  
- GPS coordinates  
- IP addresses  
- device IDs  
- biometrics  
- personal attributes  
- identifiable content  

Infrared is strictly **aggregate-in, aggregate-out**.

## 📊 Outputs

Infrared produces:

- **Warmth Index graphs** (life presence over time)  
- **Collapse Alerts** (sharp declines)  
- **Stability Metrics** (variance and continuity)  
- **Disappearance Detection** (life signals vanishing)  
- **Recovery Patterns** (life returning after disruption)  

Infrared is intentionally compatible with:

- dashboards  
- humanitarian early-warning systems  
- research tools  
- analytical databases  
- event-driven architectures  
- OMH safety infrastructure

## 🎯 Use Cases

Infrared helps detect:

- ecosystem outages  
- natural disasters  
- infrastructure failures  
- forced displacement  
- population collapse  
- silent catastrophic events  
- unrest or mass evacuation  
- system-level mortality signatures  

All **without identifying or tracking any human being**.

## 🐧 Philosophy

Infrared is built on two principles:

### **1. Every life has dignity.**  
Systems should protect the existence of people without exposing their private actions.

### **2. No population should vanish silently.**  
Disappearance—whether caused by disaster, violence, disease, or infrastructure collapse—must be detectable **without** violating privacy.

Infrared shines a faint, gentle beam of truth:  
enough to see **life**, never enough to see **individuals**.
